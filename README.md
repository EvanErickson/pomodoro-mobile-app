# Pomodoro Tracker

Made with Expo.

To run it, make sure you have the expo cli installed globally. If you want to run it locally on your iOS or Android device make sure you have the Expo Go app installed as well.

If you want to run it on a simulator, make sure you have xcode and / or android studio installed and configured.

Git clone and cd into the project. Then run expo start and then select "a" for android, or "i" for iOS.

You can select your time, etc.

Stay tuned. App will be posted on the app store soon.
